# Conway's Game of Life - Launchpad Version

This is a pretty straightforward implementation of Conway's Game of Life, on a small (8x8) grid - except I wrote it to interface with a [Novation Launchpad controller](http://us.novationmusic.com/midi-controllers-digital-dj/launchpad), to both show the grid on the Launchpad and use the Launchpad buttons to draw/erase cells on the grid. It's a good simple example of using MIDI - input AND output - in a non-music application.

Check it out, feel free to fork, submit pull requests, etc.
